## Flask MongoDB Application

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. The application uses a MongoDB database to store records.

### Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have Python (version 3.7 or higher) and MongoDB installed on your system or somewhere like public cloud. In my case my No-SQL DB runs on Free Tier https://cloud.mongodb.com/ instance


### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

Install the required Python packages using the command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1.  Make sure No-SQL DB running and operational.
2. In a new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the project directory and run the command:
```sh
python main.py
```
3. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8081 to access the application.

### Remark
Hey there! Thanks for checking out this app. I built this to demonstrate how Flask and MongoDB work together, so I didn't spend much time on the cosmetics of the web pages like Bootstrap or CSS. My focus was on the technical implementation, so we hope this app gives you some useful insights. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to get in touch with us.
